when we generate a ssh key. It generates in pair a private key and a public key.

the private key is stored in your local machine and not ment to be shared.

In other case the public key is shared to to sever.
Why do need that you ask?
well public key is used to encrypt some data that can only decrypte by the private key. So when you try to connect to a server like github.com from your local machine the server 
sends a encrypt data to the local machine then the ssh client(a program that utilized private key for authentication) decrypte the data using private key if it was successfull
then it tells the server that you have the private key.
